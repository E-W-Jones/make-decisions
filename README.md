# Make Decisions
Sick of having to make decisions? Enjoy pressing buttons? Boy do I have the python script for you!!!

simply run:
`python make_decision.py file "your filename"`
or
`python make_decision.py "thing one" "thing 2" ...`

from your terminal, and click the buttons, then the decision is made for you.

Check out the dinner.txt file for an example.
